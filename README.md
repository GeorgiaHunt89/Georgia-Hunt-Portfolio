I created a portfolio to display my previous works, during this creation I learnt to more about media queries and flex wrapping. I further developed my knowledge on columns and rows by creating a display for my previous repos.

Given this was my portfolio I took the opportunity to learn more about justification and layout, I created a clickable navigation bar that sends the reader to the appropriate section. I chose a image of a woman typing for a hero image and I placed my about me section with a justification towards the left, then flipped the article and aside for the following work section to create a dynamic flow.

Finally I mirrored the navigation bar at the bottom for the contact section in the footer, I created clickable code rather than listing my phone and email address.

Below is the HTML code I created for the portfolio:
