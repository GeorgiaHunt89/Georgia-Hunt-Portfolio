## Description

A portfolio containing all the current applications I have been working on throughout my coding bootcamp course.

## Usage Information

This project displays applications I have created that detail my current level of coding ability, during this creation I learnt to more about media queries and flex wrapping. I further developed my knowledge on columns and rows by creating a display for my previous repos.

Given this was my portfolio I took the opportunity to learn more about justification and layout, I created a clickable navigation bar that sends the reader to the appropriate section.
